## Overview
For our project we will make Minesweeper, a single-player logic puzzle type game. Players start by choosing a difficulty (easy, medium, or hard) which determines the board size. After, players select a space on the map to initially carve out and a board is randomly drawn. Around the area where the player initially clicks, there will be a sizable area of only empty Tiles outlined by a border of “numbered” Tiles. Each Tile on the board displays either a mine or the number of mines the Tile touches (if it touches no mines, nothing is displayed).  The objective of the game is for players to uncover all Tiles that do not contain a mine while avoiding (or marking) all the mines by utilizing the clues provided by the numbers in the Tiles.
## Instructions
Our game functions like a typical game of Minesweeper. Click anywhere on the board to start the game. Toggle the difficulty with the rectangle in the top right of the screen. To automatically a game that you are playing, click the 'w' key.
