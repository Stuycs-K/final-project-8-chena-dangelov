## Overview
For our project we will make Minesweeper, a single-player logic puzzle type game. Players start by choosing a difficulty (easy, medium, or hard) which determines the board size. After, players select a space on the map to initially carve out and a board is randomly drawn. Around the area where the player initially clicks, there will be a sizable area of only empty Tiles outlined by a border of “numbered” Tiles. Each Tile on the board displays either a mine or the number of mines the Tile touches (if it touches no mines, nothing is displayed).  The objective of the game is for players to uncover all Tiles that do not contain a mine while avoiding (or marking) all the mines by utilizing the clues provided by the numbers in the Tiles.
## Instructions
Our game functions like a typical game of Minesweeper (for further instructions on the gameplay, click on the hamburger button located in the top left of the screen). Click anywhere on the board to start the game. <br>
Toggle the difficulty with the drop down menu near the top of the screen that is, by default, set to "medium". To see a more in-depth look at your personal bests, and to see more tools that can be used during the game to help you win, click the hamburger button.<br>
Our program does require Processing's "Sound" library to be installed, as there is sound in the gameplay. To mute the game, click the volume icon in the top right of the screen.
