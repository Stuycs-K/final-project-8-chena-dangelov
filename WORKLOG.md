Today I altered the UML, method outline, and development phases of the prototype to reflect a new approach we have to the Minesweeper game, namely the introduction of a Tile class. These Tiles are each of the individual squares in the game board, and hold information like if they are mines are not, if they have been flagged by the viewer or not, etc.
